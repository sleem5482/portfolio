            <p className="pb-3">Hi, I’m Sleem Hashem, a creative web developer who loves turning
                complex ideas into simple, beautiful, and I am a fresh Wed Developer, I
                have developed a deep understanding of how to create websites that
                are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and responsive.
                My design philosophy revolves around combining functionality with
                aesthetic appeal. I strive to create designs that enhance user
                experience and meet business goals. I’ve had the opportunity to work
                with clients from various industries, helping them craft unique online
                identities.
                When I’m not busy designing, I’m probably diving into the latest web
                design trends, sketching new ideas, or exploring nature.
                I’m always open to new projects and collaborations—let’s build
                something amazing together!
